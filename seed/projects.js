I love the boning and pleated bust cups. She lives far from me so I had to rely on the measurements for fitting which were just right. It was my first time using a vikisews pattern and I will definitely be making more.",

The lavender hue adds a soft touch to my wardrobe, and the fabric drapes elegantly, making it perfect for both casual and dressy occasions.
